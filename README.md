<h1>List of Projects</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Below is a list of projects I worked on for my Data Science Specialisation. All code is written in R. Each section has a:

- Title
- Link to RMarkdown document on RPubs
- A short description of the project

<h3>Machine Learning - Fitness Exercise Classifier</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/machinelearning

This project's aim was to build a classifier to classify correct vs incorrect execution of a gym exercise based on activity monitors sensor data (i.e Fitbit, Nike FuelBand). The data set used for training, is readings from such trackers with classification from A (correct execution) to E (completely incorrect execution). Various training methods were selected, starting with an accuracy of 49% and moving all the way to an accuracy of 99.4% (with Random Forest).

<h3>Multivariate Regression Model for Petrol Consumption of Cars</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/regression

This paper will endeavour to answer two questions: (1) Is an automatic or manual transmission better for a car's Miles Per Gallon (MPG); (2) What are the variables that affect MPG? Based on this,s we will build a model. For this investigation we shall use the "mtcars" data set in R.

<h3>NLP - N-gram Text Analysis</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/milestoneReport

This paper analyses three text files containing tweets, news articles and blog posts in order to build features for a text predictor.

<h3>Hypothesis Testing - Effects of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/statinference

This paper will endeavour to perform basic inferential data analysis on the Tooth Growth data set. More precisely, it will assess the effects of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs, and will try and conclude if there's a strong relationship or not.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis - Effects of Weather Events on Public Health and Economy</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/RepReAssign2

This analysis will investigate the effects of weather events on public health and economic costs. The data being used is sourced from NOAA:https://www.noaa.gov/  spanning the year 1950 to 2011.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis of Activity Monitor (e.g Fitbit)</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/activityexpl

This analysis uses data from an activity monitor and it aims to answer the following questions:
- What is the mean number of steps taken per day?
- What is the average daily activity pattern?
- Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
- It also attempts to impute missing data

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis of Household Energy Consumption</h3>

http://rpubs.com/omarmn/energyconsump

This analysis visualises energy consumption in households across two days: 1/2/2007 to 2/2/2007.
